            Have you ever had that moment where you stare at your screen, just
            trying to think of a good headline for your email, website or
            product... but nothing really happens? Wouldn’t it be great to just
            skip that?

            This book was initially a Google Spreadsheet we (Gijs and Danny)
            created for our own projects. We were sick and tired of those days
            we kept looking at a blank screen, unable to come up with any
            headlines, titles or subject lines.
          </p>

          <img src="./src/img/08 1.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            We a/b tested the new headlines on the websites of our clients and
            got amazing results. Some headlines even doubled the initial
            conversion rates!

              Quickly, word spread around town, and a few co-workers asked us if
              we could share this “secret” collection of converting headlines
              with them. We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw some
              <b>very positive</b> results with these headlines as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could make.
              This success inspired us to share our collection of
              <b>200 headlines</b>
              with everyone.
